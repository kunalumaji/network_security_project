** Hierarchical Certificate Authority (CA) **

The following application is implementation of Certificate Authority (CA) server. The server is responsible for issuing X509 Certificates based on CSRs and keeping track of issued certificates.

Requirements:

-C Compiler (GCC)
-openssl library**
-make utility
-windows machine

Steps:

1. Extract the submission into seperate directory.
2. Compile the C file using following command:

    gcc -I 'path to openssl library \include' main.c -o ca_server -lcrypto -lssl -lws2_32

-----------------OR-------------------

2. Use MAKEFILE to prepare the executables. Run 'make' command in the root directory of the submission.

3. After successful compilation, 'ca_server.exe' executable is crated on root dir of project. you can start the server to listen for connections by:

    ./ca_server start-server

   It will start listening to the CSRs request if server is already authorized to do so else it will request higher level authority by sending CSR request to get authorized.

   NOTE: To register as CA you must have IP address of the higher level CA to request CA certificate.

4. To check for already issued certificate by the CA, run the following command:

    ./ca_server list-clients

    It will show all the usernames whose CSR request is signed by the CA and issued a certificate.

***Above implementation is build using 'Winsock' library. So both 'ca_server' must be on windows machine to proceed.
